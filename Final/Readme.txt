*  How to build and run the program
*******************************************************

1. Uncompress the homework.  The homework file is compressed.  
   To uncompress it use the following commands 
       % unzip [KellyFinal]

   Now you should see a directory named homework with the files:
        main.cpp
        actorActressTreeFunctions.cpp
        actorActressTreeFunctions.hpp
        BSTree.cpp
        BSTree.hpp
        dataTypes.cpp
        dataTypes.hpp
        functions.cpp
        functions.hpp
        Node.h
        makefile
        Readme.txt

2. Build the program.

    Change to the directory that contains the file by:
    % cd [KellyFinal] 

    Compile the program by:
    % make

3. Run the program by:
   % ./main.out

4. Delete the obj files, executables, and core dump by
   %./make clean
